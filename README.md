# Xtreme ML Hack on AnalyticsVidhya
The hackathon was hosted on 20th - 23rd April, 2017. I modelled Contacts and Resolution independently, and it was one of the few times where using simple averages beat all ML-models I tried, so ended up sticking with a weighted average solution.

1. Please edit the paths in the files before running them.
2. I blended this model with Mark's ML-based solution, which gave our best score (64.94) on public LB and ranked 1st on private LB.

Thanks to [Mark Landry](https://github.com/mlandry22) ([Link to his model](https://github.com/mlandry22/AVdatafest-Xtreme-ML-Hack)), for teaming up and sharing some interesting insights and ideas. Hope to collaborate again in the times to come!
